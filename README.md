# Applet farming simulator

-----

## About

Basically, game for major assignment, year 11 compsci.
I was originally going to make a shooter game because heehee shooty shoot
funny but then I realised that there were a bunch of other people doing that
kekw.

sO I decided to make a *farming simulator* instead.

Why? I don't know. I just thought it would be fun to make a farming simulator

## How to Run

Because compsci bad ( course, not the teacher :) ), we are using applets for this shit. I'm not sorry tho. Cope.

I used IntelliJ to make this, so I can only really help you if you use IntelliJ.
You're gonna need [this plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/13148-java-applets-support) to run the applet.
IntelliJ doesn't support applets by default, because they're old and decrepit.

Once you have that installed, set a build configuration to run the App.java in the src folder.
Then, run the applet. It *should* work.

## Controls

WASD to move.

You are the colored circle that moves when you press the move buttons. The three colored squares (i started working on sprites, but i couldnt put them in the applet cos im stupid, ill try again tho) are objects that will change your "farming mode";

- The green square is seeding mode. In this mode, walking over the empty brown soil squares will plant seeds that will grow into a harvestable crop

- The blue square is watering mode. In this mode, walking over a plant in any stage of growth causes it to grow instantly. This is a bug, its meant to make the crop grow by 1 stage. wontfix

- The gray square is harvesting mode. In this mode, walking over a fully grown crop will harvest it, adding 1 DOLLAS to your account. Whats the point of DOLLAS? Good question.

## License

This code is fucking horrible. I refuse to believe someone will ever want to use it.

But if you do, go ahead. I don't care. Just don't sue me if it breaks your computer.
